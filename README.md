# Abolfazl Shahsavand - Personal Portfolio

## Overview
This is my personal portfolio website, a comprehensive project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my skills, experiences, academic background, and personal projects. The website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices. It is deployed on GitHub Pages, making it accessible to anyone online. The project adheres to the guidelines provided by my university (AUT) for the "Personal Portfolio Website Project" assignment, with a focus on clean code, proper structure, and interactive elements.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices with a toggleable navigation bar.
- **Multiple Sections**: Includes Home, About Me, Experience, Projects, and Contact sections.
- **Interactive Elements**: JavaScript-powered navigation toggle for mobile usability.
- **Project Showcase**: Highlights real GitHub projects with detailed descriptions and links.
- **Downloadable CV**: Provides a link to download my resume in PDF format.
- **Contact Information**: Includes email and social media links for easy communication.

## Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the website with all sections (Home, About Me, Experience, Projects, Contact).
- `style.css`: The CSS file responsible for styling, including responsive design with media queries.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity, such as the navbar toggle functionality.
- `image.png`: My profile photo displayed in the Home section.
- `cv.pdf`: A downloadable PDF version of my resume (prepared separately, e.g., using LaTeX).
- `README.md`: This file, providing detailed documentation of the project.

## How to Run
The website is hosted live on GitHub Pages. You can view it directly at: [https://AbolfazlShahsavand.github.io](https://AbolfazlShahsavand.github.io)

For local testing:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/AbolfazlShahsavand/AbolfazlShahsavand.github.io.git`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd AbolfazlShahsavand.github.io`
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) to view the site locally.

## Installation and Setup
- **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Git installed to clone the repository.
- **Steps**:
  - Install Git: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) if not already installed.
  - Clone the repo as described above.
  - No additional dependencies are required since the project uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Note**: For the CV to work, place `cv.pdf` in the project folder and ensure the filename matches the link in `index.html`.

## Development Process
- **Tools Used**: Visual Studio Code, Git, and GitHub.
- **Version Control**: Followed a commit policy with messages like `feat:`, `fix:`, `style:`, and `docs:` (e.g., `git commit -m "feat: add project section"`).
- **Responsive Design**: Implemented using CSS media queries (`@media (max-width: 600px)`) to ensure compatibility with mobile devices.
- **Testing**: Tested locally and on GitHub Pages with multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox) and devices.

## Future Improvements
- Add more projects to the Projects section to reflect additional work.
- Implement a contact form using JavaScript (if security constraints allow).
- Enhance the design with CSS animations or a custom color scheme.
- Optimize images (e.g., compress `image.png`) for faster loading.
